Repo to be cloned in the git repository of get_next_line.

Once cloned you can run the bash script and it will compile your get_next_line.c, get_next_line_utils.c and get_next_line.h files together with the main.c file in this repo.
Then it will try to print out each line of the files in /text_files with your functions.
You can add aditional files the program should test by just adding a new file in the /text_files directory. The script will go through each of the files in there.
